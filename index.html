      <h1>The Void</h1>
      <p>
        Here is the palace of void. There is nothing, but its everything.
        Nothing means not literally nothing, it means void. Void is kind of
        nothingness that in it's presense there exists eveything. Its not called
        ignorance. It is the exact opposite of it. In essense it convoys the
        concept of emptyness in mind.
